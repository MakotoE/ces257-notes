# Genderbread

- Four elements to the genderbread person:
    - Gender identity
        - How you experience and define your gender internally
        - Gender may be defined by social roles, attitudes, disposition, and personality traits
    - Gender expression
        - How you present your gender
        - Fashion, demeanor, hobbies, etc.
        - Is usually fluid - can fluctuate day by day and hour by hour
    - Anatomical sex
        - The physical traits, also known as sex characteristics, and the sex assigned at birth
        - Intersex - Having sex characteristics that are both male and female. For example, someone can have an external appearance of one sex and have the reproductive system of another sex.
    - Attraction
        - How people are drawn to others sexually, romantically, and in other ways
        - Alfred Kinsey found the people do not have attraction based on binary gender identities but on a seven point scale
- These gender concepts are not interconnected, as someone can have a different gender identity than expression. But
  they are interrelated culturally.
- Gender can be expressed with a spectrum
    - Gender identity
    ```
    <------------------------->
    Woman    Genderqueer    Man
    ```
    - Gender expression
    ```
    <---------------------------------->
    Feminine    Androgynous    Masculine
    ```
    - Anatomical sex
    ```
    <------------------------>
    Female    Intersex    Male
    ```
    - Attraction
    ```
    <----------------->
    Men    All    Women
    ```
- A spectrum improves upon the binary selection
- Not all people can identity within a spectrum system
- A "-ness" model of visualizing gender
    - Gender identity
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Woman-ness
    ∅ ----------->
    Man-ness
    ```
    - Gender expression
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Femininity
    ∅ ----------->
    Masculinity
    ```
    - Anatomical sex
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Female-ness
    ∅ ----------->
    Male-ness
    ```
    - Sexual attraction
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Woman a/o feminine a/o female people
    ∅ ----------->
    Men a/o masculine a/o male people
    ```
    - Romantic attraction
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Woman a/o feminine a/o female people
    ∅ ----------->
    Men a/o masculine a/o male people
    ```
- A "-ness" model allows identity in an amount of multiple values
  - The spectrum model doesn't allow someone to choose both of two sides, or none of both sides
  - The "-ness" model allows combining multiple traits

# Before Stonewall

1. What sparks the evolution of gay culture (and a gay underground) in the US in the 1920s?

A gay underground was established in San Fransisco, New Orleans, Harlem, and Greenwich Village. In the era of speakeasies, people met others of their kind in bars. Parties happened under the radar.

3. How does WW2 serve as a way for gays and lesbians to find each other?

Men and women serving in segregated companies could explore their feelings away from home and their families. Everyone was needed in the military, regardless of race or sexuality. Women who served had financial independence for the first time in American history and did not have to depend on a husband.

3. Why are gays persecuted in the 1950s? What is going on politically and socially?

The lavender scare during the 1950s was a time when the American government was investigating and persecuting homosexual people in the belief that they were a threat to the country. During this period, Eisenhower's Executive Order 10450 barred gay people from federal employment. As the war was over, women were expected to marry men.

The Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis, formed in the 1950s, were gay rights and lesbian rights organizations, respectively. They started an early uprising against the government witch-hunting.

4. Why do you think gay bars have been a building block of the LGBTQ community

The secretive nature of speakeasies during Prohibition meant that people could meet without (or almost without) fear of arrest. This tradition lived on after Prohibition.

5. This film is old… true. But what did you think of hearing direct voices and testimonies of elders within the LGBTQ community? 

They seemed to have experienced both fear and joy in their lives. They lived through times of oppression and persecution. But by supporting each other in the community, they found moments of joy and comfort, and they showed this through the smiles. To take this away because of sexuality is, what I think, an unspeakable act.

# Black Gay (Raw) Sex

- This essay is written by Bailey who identifies as black, gay, and as a man. He explains that HIV prevention literature lacks understanding of black gay men's culture.
- The CDC released a report that 46 percent of black gay men in certain cities were infected with HIV and 67 of those infected were unaware of their HIV infection
- The common focus of prevention efforts is on condom use, but it has not proven effective in reducing HIV prevalence among black gay men
- As black gay men tend to have a small socialsexual network, black gay men tend to have a higher chance of being infected
- In the national HIV prevention agenda, they try to test and treat high-risk individuals. There are financial barriers to testing and treatment among working-class black men.
    - The ongoing high prevalence of HIV infection among black gay men suggests that prevention efforts are not effective

# The Sex Markers We Carry

- A lot of daily activities depend on a drivers license
    - The drivers license contains the person's sex marker
    - For transgender individuals, the sex marker may be a source of confusion and embarassment
    - The sex marker can be used as a way to discriminate transgender individuals
- Some government agencies do not define the terms sex and gender for documents
- Gender theorists challenge the ideas that gender is an immutable characteristic or that sex is binary
- Though gender identity and expression are different, they are intertwined through social customs
- The sex marker on a birth certificate is determined soley by the presence of a penis or vagina
    - Sex markers on drivers licenses and passports are based on the genitalia at birth
- Not every parenting couple consists of a mother and a father
    - Hospitals may use the terms "delivering parent" and "second parent"
- Intersex individuals have male and female sex characteristics
    - Medical procedures may be done early in development to "correct" characteristics that do not match their sex
    - When growing up, intersex individuals may feel conflicted with their identity or body
- Though birth certificates are used for many programs, the sex marker is not vital to any objective
- The drivers license and passport depends on the birth certificate
- The REAL ID Act aimed at standardizing drivers licenses uses the term "gender, drivers licenses use the term "sex," and those terms seem to be used interchangably
- Birth certificates and drivers licenses used to contain a race marker
    - Race is subject to perspective of the individual and third-parties
- Sex marker is not helpful in guarding against identity fraud because people can easily present as another gender
    - It is even easier to fake sex identity online
- States used to require sex reassignment surgery or medical treatment as a requirement to change the sex marker
    - The assumption that there is something to "correct" is misleading
    - Not all transgender people are "trapped in the wrong body"
- Adding more sex marker options such as "X" may be supported by non-binary individuals
    - Some feel stigmatized by the idea of a "separate but equal" category and would not help reduce discrimination
- Sex classification has been used for two legitimate reasons
    - Sex-specific policies such as conscription
    - For sex-based affirmative action policies
        - Because the sex marker depends on genitalia at birth and not the current sex, it is not relevant and is an invasion of privacy
- As the racial identity questions on the census has been contested over time, sex classification on the census should be critically assessed
- Other biometric teachniques like fingerprinting may be more useful due to its unchanging and empirical feature
    - Biometric collection is invasive and increases government surveillance
- Removing the sex marker from documents will help reduce sex-identity discrimination

# Bathroom Bouncers

- Khadijah Farmer entered the women's restroom and was suspected of being a man
    - The bouncer forced her out of the restroom, even if Farmer offered to show her ID card

- A 2008 survey showed that 70% of transgender people in Washington D.C. have been denied access, verbally harassed, or physically assaulted in public restrooms
- North Carolina had a bathroom bill, HB2, which mandates that people must use the restroom pertaining to their biological sex as indicated on the birth certificate
- Sexual orientation is commonly mixed with gender expression
    - When people perceive a person's sexual orientation, they are not observing sexual acts but are judging based on appearence
    - Therefore, homophobia may be about policing gender norms than policing same-sex activity
- Race influences transphobia
    - Farmer was accused of being a black man in the women's restroom
    - The experience of a black transgender man is different than that of a white transgender man
    - Society in general is more defensive of black people in restroom than white people
- The first feminists focused on fighting for women's restrooms in addition to the men's restrooms
    - Next, the time inequality became of issue where the women's restrooms have long lines unlike men's restrooms
- Sex-segregation has similarities to racial segregation because of the "equal but seperate" rules
    - Women's restrooms may be less maintained, which mirrors how the colored restrooms were filthy and unmaintained
    - However, while colored people were barred from public accommodation, women and men get equal accommodation
- Segregation is argued to make bathrooms safer
    - If predetors are breaking the law, they would enter the women's restroom without hesitation
- The assimilationist approach of a nondiscrimination policy would not work
    - People are still not prevented from questioning and harassing others
    - Only provides spaces for binary genders
    - A gender-neutral bathroom that is apart from the two men and women's sides stigmatizes transgender identities
- No-gender bathrooms may be the solution
    - Current segregated bathrooms can be converted into no-gender bathrooms
    - Single restrooms for all genders are being built

# Checking a Sex Box to Get into College

- Calliope Wong applied to admission for Smith College
    - She is a transgender woman
    - Her application was rejected because the high school transcript had a male sex marker
    - Even after fixing this, her second application was rejected because the FAFSA documentation listed her sex as male
    - What documentation serves to prove that someone is of a particular gender or sex?
- The necessity of a sex marker on college applications is questioned
    - Even for coed colleges, the sex marker is required on the application
    - What definition of sex or gender are they using?

    - Simple things like an option on a paycheck to divide the salary between the worker and the spouse ignite changes in thinking
    - Women's colleges can open admission to all genders and retain their feminist mission
- Smith now explicitly includes transgender women for admission
    - Whether or not gender-nonforming people or transgender men with a female sex marker are included in their definition is not clear.
    - None of the men's colleges define men
- There is an argument that girls and boys of grade school have different brains and need single-sex education
    - All-black male schools do not empower black boys but marginalize those who do not conform to masculine standards
    - Some single-sex colleges describe how sexes have different biological makeup
    - It brings to question how they view transitioning or gender-nonconforming individuals
    - The use of "artifical constraints" and statistical sex sterotypes often result in nothing but prejudice
- Colleges should make the sex marker optional on their applications
    - They should acknowledge the temporaral nature of the sex marker
    - They can also ask prospective students how their own sex identity relate to the college's mission to fight sexism

# Seeing Sex in the Body

- Caster Semenya was disqualified from the women's 800 meter

    - She has hyperandrogenism: has XX chromosomes but elevated androgen levels which makes some body parts appear masculine
    - She went through a visual genitalia test
    - Competitors criticized her track records based on her masculine looks
    - This kind of homophobia may be related to racism, as black women are sterotyped as being more masculine than white women. Serena and Venus Williams have been subject to the same sterotypes.
- As bodies are directly involved in sport, sex identity is closely inspected
    - People are also born with other genetic advantages
    - Sport isn't just about winning; camaraderie, self-discipline, and recreation are part of sport

        - Top-level athletes are role-models and people follow these role-models
        - Sends a message that sex identity is visually obvious and stable over time
- How the olympics identifies sex
    - The IOC's first sex-verification policy was a "nude parade" where athletes' genitals were visually examined
    - The nude parade was replaced with a mouth swab to identify the sex chromosomes
    - The current test is on the functional teststerone levels
    - There is no test for being a man
- In the NCAA, a transgender female athlete using testosterone may only compete as female
    - A transgender male athlete who is not using testosterone may compete as male or female
    - A transgender female athlete who is not using hormone treatments may not compete as female
- Those in favor of sex equality argue that sex segregation enables a fair playing field
    - It is reminiscent of the "man in the women's bathroom" panic: masculine female players are accused of harming other female players
- Feminism and sports
    - The 1970s feminist movement focused on assimilation of female athletes into male-only sports. Women's teams were created.
    - Then, feminists fought for making female sports equal to those of men's
    - Little League only accepted boys, until 1992 when state court ruled that federal public accommodations nondiscrimination laws apply to Little League
    - Public accomodations law has been used to assimilate transgender women into female-only organizations
- A policy that is based on birth sex assumes that our assigned sex determined by the genitals is the same our entire life
- The LPGA approach to examining trans female golfer's status on a case-by-case basis is a reactive approach rather than a proactive approach
- Accommodation for female sports
    - Many female sports organizations use different rules and fields than those of male counterparts
    - WNBA uses a smaller basketball than NBA, LPGA uses shorter golf courses
    - It perptuates the idea of female inferiority
    - There has been no effort to recruit significant number of women for NHL, NFL, PGA, or NBA
- What sport really means in the commercial world
    - Sports are sold as a showcase of excellence in talents and gifted abilities
    - Those talents are usually financially dependent
    - More marketable athletes gain popularity
- Administrative bodies should state the purposes for sex-segregation
    - Organizations should be proactive on inclusion rather than reactive
    - At highly competitive levels, physiological features like height, weight, and androgen levels should be considered for sorting purposes
- Sex segregation harms athletes
    - It harms intersex and transgender athletes
    - It harms cisgender athletes who are told that they do not fit into masculine and feminine norms

# What's Wrong with Rights?

- Trans equality advocates have pursed reform in: anti-discrimination laws that protect gender identities and hate crime laws
- Discrimination and violence against people of color have persisted despite hate crime laws
    - Systemic racism has not been addressed by the laws
- Anti-discrimination laws are not adequetly enforced
    - Most people who are discrminated against cannot afford legal help
    - The Supreme Court has made it hard to prove discrimination
    - Trans litigants have lost discrmination cases regarding bathrooms at work, because it was not interpreted as a violation of law
- Discrimination laws fail to understand how racism works and fails to effectively address it
    - Discrimination laws categorizes actors of racism into perpetrator and victim, which makes racism seem like individual problems. Systemic racism involves more than just the perpetrator.
    - Racial divide in schools and their conditions and budgets are not understood as violations under discrimination laws
    - Discrimination laws assume that the playing field is fair for everyone when it is inherently unequal
    - Fixing discriminatory policies does not solve systematic racism and transphobia
- Hate crime laws work by punishing the perpetrator
    - The perpetrator is not informed of all laws, so laws will not stop their bias-motivated violence 
    - Hate crime laws would not increase the life chances of victims
    - Hate crime laws legitimize the criminal punishment system
    - Would the queer community feel comfortable siding with the police who also colludes with racist, transphobic attacks on citizens?
    - Hate crime laws give an illusion that the criminal punishment system provides safety while it only increases violence
    - Even though hate crime laws aim to punish bad people, it only locks up marginalized communities
    - Hate crime laws add more people to the list that the criminal justice system can lock up
    - Prison reform efforts only succeed in increasing the budgets of prisons
- We need to examine how welfare systems, punishment systems, health care systems, immigration systems, etc. sort people into security or insecurity.
    - We can use legal reform to dismantle capitalist involvement in politics and create alternative methods of meeting human needs and organizing political participation

- For queer immigrants seeking asylum, they have to prove repression in their home country while hiding their non-normative backgrounds.
    - The idea of family reunification is preferred over labor issues. Many queers leave their families due to an unwelcome family.
