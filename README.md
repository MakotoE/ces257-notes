- Four elements to the genderbread person:
    - Gender identity
        - How you experience and define your gender internally
        - Gender may be defined by social roles, attitudes, disposition, and personality traits

    - Attraction
        - How people are drawn to others sexually, romantically, and in other ways
        - Alfred Kinsey found the people do not have attraction based on binary gender identities but on a seven point scale

  they are interrelated culturally.

# The Charmed Circle

- The Charmed Circle is a diagram by Gayle Rubin illustrating how Western cultures dictate what are good sexual practices and what are bad sexual practices
    - Inner elements inside the charmed circle describe good sexual acts and the outside circle include bad sexual acts
    - Good sex practices include: Married, heterosexual, bodies only, no pornography
    - Bad sex practices include: In sin, homosexual, with manufactured objects, pornography
- The sex herarchy contains a scale of best to worst in terms of acceptability and labels sexual acts on this scale
- Highlights the tendency of society to sort sexual acts into good and bad categories
    - No other areas of daily life are scrutinized as much as sex
- The good practices are legitimized and considered natural while bad practices are disparaged
- When society tries to draw a line between good and bad sex, minority and majority groups clash on this judgement
