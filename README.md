# Genderbread

- Four elements to the genderbread person:
    - Gender identity
        - How you experience and define your gender internally
        - Gender may be defined by social roles, attitudes, disposition, and personality traits
    - Gender expression
        - How you present your gender
        - Fashion, demeanor, hobbies, etc.
        - Is usually fluid - can fluctuate day by day and hour by hour
    - Anatomical sex

        - Intersex - Having sex characteristics that are both male and female. For example, someone can have an external appearance of one sex and have the reproductive system of another sex.
    - Attraction
        - How people are drawn to others sexually, romantically, and in other ways
        - Alfred Kinsey found the people do not have attraction based on binary gender identities but on a seven point scale
- These gender concepts are not interconnected, as someone can have a different gender identity than expression. But
  they are interrelated culturally.
- Gender can be expressed with a spectrum
    - Gender identity

    ```
    - Gender expression
    ```
    <---------------------------------->
    Feminine    Androgynous    Masculine
    ```
    - Anatomical sex
    ```
    <------------------------>
    Female    Intersex    Male
    ```
    - Attraction
    ```
    <----------------->
    Men    All    Women
    ```
- A spectrum improves upon the binary selection
- Not all people can identity within a spectrum system
- A "-ness" model of visualizing gender
    - Gender identity
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Woman-ness
    ∅ ----------->
    Man-ness
    ```
    - Gender expression
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Femininity
    ∅ ----------->
    Masculinity
    ```
    - Anatomical sex
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Female-ness
    ∅ ----------->
    Male-ness
    ```
    - Sexual attraction
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Woman a/o feminine a/o female people
    ∅ ----------->
    Men a/o masculine a/o male people
    ```
    - Romantic attraction
    ```
    ∅ ----------->
    Woman a/o feminine a/o female people
    ∅ ----------->
    Men a/o masculine a/o male people

  - The spectrum model doesn't allow someone to choose both of two sides, or none of both sides
  - The "-ness" model allows combining multiple traits

    - Men and women needed to produce offspring for the survival of the family
    - Records of homosexual attraction at the time exist
- As wage labor became more common, men and women were drawn out of the self-sufficient household economy and worked as individuals
- In the 1920s, a family became a unit that produced not goods but emotional satisfaction
- Birthrate declined, and sexuality became a means for pleasure
- In the 1850s to the 1900s, gay men and lesbians established communities
- Gay men have been more visible then lesbians due to the public male sphere and te private female sphere
- While men could financially support themselves, women had to rely on a relationship with men to survive
- During WWII, men and women were employeed in gender-segregated institutions
    - Young men and women could meet others of their own gender and explore their sexualities
    - Gay bars were established

    - 1970s saw significant civil rights achivements by the gay liberation movement
- Capitalism has a two-fold effect on society's perspective on family
    - Capitalism has undermined the material basis of the nuclear family with free labor
        - Individuals could be self-supportive and have relationships of their own accord
    - People view the family as the source of love, affection, and emotional security
        - Each generation comes from heterosexual parents who teach heterosexual models of relationships
- Capitalism influenced the population so that there are more gay men and lesbians than in the past
- To act against homophobia generated by families, we need programs that will dissove the boundaries of the family with daycare centers and neighborhood institutions so that groups of families work and socialize together
- I don't agree with this essay at all. Neoliberal capitalism has created an unequal landscape where the rich silences the majority, the poor. Even the government is overrun by the rich. The rich is profitting by manipulating and silencing the LGBT movement. We need to seperate money from law and to fight against the oligarchy.
