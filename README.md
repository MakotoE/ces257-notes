    - Attraction
        - How people are drawn to others sexually, romantically, and in other ways
        - Kinsey found the people do not have attraction based on binary gender identities but on a seven point scale
- These gender concepts are not interconnected, as someone can have a different gender identity than expression. But
  they are interrelated culturally.
- Gender can be expressed with a spectrum
